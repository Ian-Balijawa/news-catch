  summary:
    "It has been close to eight months since you were appointed NRM secretary general. How has it been so far?First, it's an honour for me to have been nominated by the President to become the secretary general of the NRM party. At this point in time it comes with huge responsibility and a lot of challenges. Knowing the history of the party; membership of the party; period the party has been in office; and achievements of the party all come with a lot of expectations and challenges. It has been the busiest period in my life.",
